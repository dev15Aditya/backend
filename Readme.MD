This is backend of the contact list project. Here we are using express.

It has a entry point 'index.js'. It handles the whole application.
To make it less complex, I have made models and routes separately to avoid any confusion.

To manage/connect to MongoDB database, I have used mongoose.

For further details please ping me.
